# Neonicotinoid-Pesticides-and-Honey-Bee-Productivity-in-the-US-1991-2017---EDA

In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I will look for correlations in the use of Neonicotinoid Pesticides and 
Honey Bee populations and productivity throughout the US. 
I will be conducting my data analysis using the kaggle dataset "Honeybees and Neonic Pesticides" by Kevin Smith.
Data was acquired through the USGS and USDA.
